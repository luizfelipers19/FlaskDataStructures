# Flask-DataStructures

A simple API project to explore the application of Data Structures, such as Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks and Binary Search Trees, on the processing of data during HTTP requests on the Flask framework. For this project, the approach that was taken was purely a wheel reinventing, mostly because applying all these data structures wasn't necessary, once the ORM (sql alchemy) could handle all the data processing in a fast-forward way, but understanding how the ORM applies data structures behind the curtains is something worth the time.
